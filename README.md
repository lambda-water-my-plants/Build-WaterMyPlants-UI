# Build Week - Water My Plants Project  
## UI1: Josh Cooter  

### What problem does your app solve?  
The Water My Plants App will serve as a reminder for the optimal time to water our plants.  

### How does your app solve the problem?  
Our app takes in information about the type of plant, and automatically sends out a text reminder to let people know that it is time to water their plants.  

### What is the mission statement?  
The Water My Plants app ensures plant lovers never need to worry about scheduling or wondering about when the best time to water their plants are - we do it for you!

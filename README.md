# Build Week - Water My Plants Project  
## UI1: Josh Cooter  

### What problem does your app solve?  
The Water My Plants App will serve as a reminder for the optimal time to water our plants.  

### How does your app solve the problem?  
Our app takes in information about the type of plant, and automatically sends out a text reminder to let people know that it is time to water their plants.  

### What is the mission statement?  
The Water Mypp ensures plant lovers never need to worry about scheduling or wondering about when the best time to water their plants are - we do it for you!
